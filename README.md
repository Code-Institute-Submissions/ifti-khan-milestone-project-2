## Google Powered API Tradesperson Platform

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a Google powered API Tradesperson platform for Google Places registered businesses/person and for those who are self-employed and who are not registered with Google Places. The reason I have come up with this project idea is to help people find the right business or person for a services that they require.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that I have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that I have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and APIs.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have that interactive element for users which will take it one step further from a static website.

# UX – User Experience

## The who?
The projects has a dual purpose, the first purpose is that it will help users find the right business or person that they require for a specific service who are registered to Google Places. The second purpose is that it will help self-employed people who are not registered with Google Places to advertise their services to users. 

When I say unregistered I mean a business or person who is not registered to Google Places, not in the sense that the business or person is not certified in that trade. So this project will help those who are not registered with Google Places to help them advertise their service and find work, not only through a friend or the spoken word but online using the Google Maps API.   

## The what?
The project will help users of the platform to find a tradesperson where ever they are in thr world. It will also be a platform for businesses around the world, in cities, towns or even a small villages to advertise their services to users in the same area or around them.

## The how?
I will be using a variety of different technologies to create this project, the first and most important is utilising Googles API which are Google Places and Google Maps. To help the user search for a tradesperson a search form will be created that will allow users to select a country. Then a town or city they are in and then filtering the search further to a specific tradesperson not all at once. Once the search parameters have been inputted to then display the results to the user using Google maps with markers and also displaying the business or tradespersons info below for them to see.  

This part is for the registered business or person with Google, the second part will be for those people or business or are not registered with Google Places, this will be done the same way but the main difference is that it will be done manually and not utilising an API. The whole project will be responsive, it will also incorporate interactive elements and be fully accessible for all users. 

# User Stories
My users for this project are people who are in need of a tradesperson who require their service for an issue they are having or an emergency like a burst water pipe. The user could also be looking a quotation for a future project they are planning.

# Validation
In this section I have used a few different validation techniques to thoroughly make sure my project is fully compliant and accessible. I have used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 online validation tools as well as a online contrast checker for the colours that i used in my project.

If there is any non-compliant code or warnings within the project I will document it and then fix it and this will be the first step of my testing and debugging.

HTML5 Validation -> [Visit Site]( https://validator.w3.org/)

CSS3 Validation -> [Visit Site]( https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

WebAIM Contrast Checker -> [Visit Site]( https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

# Testing
When it comes to testing and debugging I found it easier and good practise to test as I went along with my project and this can be seen in my git commit messages to my repository every time I pushed my completed files. The tool that i used through out my project to help me with my test and debug was Google Chrome Dev Tools.

In this section I will test my project against my user stories and further text by doing some manual testing. These test will be done using a variety of different browsers and a variety of different screen sizes as well to ensure my projects compatibly and responsiveness.

# UX - User Story Testing
Here in this section i will provide a user story scenario with screenshot examples with steps if necessary to test my project against my user story.

### UX User Story Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/user_story_document.md)

# Further Testing
I have decided to further test my project by listing all features and functions within my project and then manually test each one. I will test my project in a variety of different browser to ensure it is fully compatible. The browsers I have chosen are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Opera. I will test to see if all of the features and functions work as well as my font, images, hover animation and project responsiveness.

### Further Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/further_testing_document.md)

Throughout the whole project i developed my porject on my Dell Inspiron 15inch Laptop and my Acer 24inch Monitor. I also used used Chrome Dev tools whilst programming my project and used the responsive tool to simulate different device sizes. I also did some physical testing on a few devices such as my Samsung Galaxy S20+, Samsung Galaxy Tab 6.
