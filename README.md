## Local Business Directory

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a local business directory for small to medium size business and for those who are self employed. The reason i have come up with this project idea is to help people in my local area find the right business or person during this very tough time but to also help support these business and people at the same time.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that i have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that i have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have the interactive element for the users as well taking it that one step further than a stactic website.
