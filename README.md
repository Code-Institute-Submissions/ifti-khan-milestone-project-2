## Google Powered API Tradesperson Finder

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a Google powered API Tradesperson finder for Google registered businesses/person and for those who are self-employed and who are not registered with Google. The reason I have come up with this project idea is to help people find the right business or person for a services that they require.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that I have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that I have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and APIs.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have that interactive element for users which will take it one step further from a static website.


# UX â€“ User Experience

## The who?
The projects has a dual purpose, the first purpose is that it will help people find the right business or person that they require for a specific service who are registered to Google. The second purpose is that it will help self-employed people who are not registered with Google to advertise their services to users.

## The what?
The project will serve as a platform to help businesses and people around the world, in cities, towns or even a small village to advertise their services to users in the same area or around them.

## The how?
I will be using a variety of different technologies to create this project, the first and most important is utilising Googles API and then connecting it to a search from that will allow users to select a country. Then a town or city they are in and then filtering the search further to a specific tradesperson. Once the search parameters have been inputted to then display the results to the user using Google maps with markers and also displaying the business or tradespersons info below for them to see.

This part is for the registered business or person with Google, the second part will be for those people or business or are not registered with Google, this will be done the same way but the main difference is that it will be done manually and not utilising an API. The whole project will be responsive, it will also incorporate interactive elements and be fully accessible for all users.
