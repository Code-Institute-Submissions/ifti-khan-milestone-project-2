## Google Powered API Tradesperson Finder

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a Google powered API Tradesperson finder for Google registered businesses/person and for those who are self-employed and who are not registered with Google. The reason I have come up with this project idea is to help people find the right business or person for a services that they require.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that I have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that I have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and APIs.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have that interactive element for users which will take it one step further from a static website.
