## Local Business Directory

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a local business directory for small to medium size business and for those who are self-employed. The reason I have come up with this project idea is to help people in my local area find the right business or person during this very tough time but to also help support these business and people at the same time.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that I have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that I have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and APIs.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have the interactive element for the users as well taking it that one step further than a static website.

# UX â€“ User Experience

## The who?
The projects has a dual purpose, the first being it help users in a local area to find the right business or person for a service that they require. The second purpose is that it will help local businesses and the self-employed to advertise their services to the users.

## The what?
This project will allow users to find businesses in their local area like a takeaway/restaurant or even a construction business that can provide a quote for a home project. It will also allow users to find people who are self-employed like an electrician, plumber or even a hairdresser.

This project will serve as a platform not only for users but for businesses and the self-employed, to help them find work within the local area by advertising to user the service that they can provide for them.

## The how?
I will get in contact with local businesses and people in my local area and ask for their permission to advertise their business or service on my website at first. After I have to get the necessary key information to start my project, I will then incorporate a contact form where businesses and people can then send in their information to be advertise on my project site.

The design of the project will be elegant and eye catching to the users but the most important part is that it will get straight to the point and show users the key information of the business or service. All the users has to do is find the business or service they require, read the key information and get in contact with the business or person to find out more.
