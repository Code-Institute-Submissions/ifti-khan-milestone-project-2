# Main CSS (style.css)

After running the CSS3 online validation, the final results came in that I had no errors but had 3 warnings, please see screenshot below.

This first warning is nothing serious because it relates to the Google font import and the online validator did not check it. The second and third warnings are simple fixes, all i did was change the background colour from white to transparent for both buttons hover effects.

# Contrast Checker

I used this online contrast checker, the reason I had chosen to do this is to make sure that my project meets accessibility standards. 

### Body
The screenshot below shows that the background colour and foreground colour that I have chosen for my project body and it passes.

The screenshot below shows that the background colour and foreground colour that I have chosen for my project header and project footer and it passes.

### Hover and Active Classes
The screenshot below shows that the background colour and foreground colour that I have chosen for my hover and active classes and it fails on the background colour.

After seeing the background colour not meeting the accessibility standards, i decided to change the background colour so that it could meet accessibility standards.
